# JMeter

This project is one of many tasks I have completed during my time at <b>Beetroot Academy</b>. First of all, Apache JMeter is primarily used to measure and analyze the performance and load capacity of web applications, APIs, and various other services.

The task that had to be done:
1) Create a set of GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE requests to the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) that are sent within 10 seconds in 3 iterations. Apply 3 different assertions to each of the requests. The results of the tests should be received by the following listeners: View Results in Tree, Summary Report. Describe the conclusions of the test results (based on the reporters) in a separate file.
2) Create a new test plan based on the test plan from the previous task. Make a stress test of the used API for each of the requests. Identify the minimum combinations of parameters that will cause the web service to stop withstanding the load.

That is, to perform this task it is necessary to carry out load and stress testing. This repository contains the files with the completed tasks, as well as a report on the test completion.
